1
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:59,100
{\an8}洛基
第一季 第三集

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,060
{\pos(190.2,132)}前情提要

3
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,100
{\pos(191.1,129.6)}拉曼蒂斯1号

4
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,240
这是宇宙里最强大的力量吗
Is this the greatest power in the universe?

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,390
一名在逃时间异体一直在杀害我们的时间卫队
A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,750
不管这个时间异体是谁
Whoever this Variant is,

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,550
我们一直没能找到他
we haven't been able to find him.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,420
时间变异管理局
The Time Variance Authority

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,820
和阿斯加德的神们都一样
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,840
因权力而迷醉  对真相视而不见
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,840
时间守护者在密切关注此案的方方面面
The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,330
他躲在了天启里
He's hiding in apocalypses.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,520
你就是时管局叫来追捕我的笨蛋
You're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,320
你  是我吧
Me, I presume.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,250
我要推翻时间守护者
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,670
我没兴趣统治时间变异管理局
I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,070
我泄密了
I gave it away.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,820
时间守护者  他们的所在
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,200
你想要什么
What do you want?

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,400
不  等等  洛基
No! No! Loki, wait!

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,580
等等  洛基  等一下
Wait! Loki, wait!

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,110
不  等等  洛基
No! Wait, Loki!

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,410
我们可以试试土豆皮或水牛指
We could do potato skins or buffalo fingers...

24
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,080
我们也可以去别处吃
Or we could eat somewhere else.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,510
你为什么讨厌这里
Why do you hate this place?

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,250
我不讨厌它  我恐惧它
I don't hate it, I fear it.

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,320
你知道卫生部
Do you know how many times

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,860
关过这里几次吗
the health department has closed this place down?

29
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,900
酒水似乎还行
Well, the drinks seem fine.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,690
天啊
Oh, God!

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,280
大脑冻住了
Ah, brain freeze!

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,250
你知道大脑冻住是什么意思吧
You know what brain freeze is, don't you?

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,270
又来了
Here we go.

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,310
就是当你啜饮了很冷的东西
It's when you sip something so cold...

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,160
大脑冻住跟冷有关  懂了
Brain freeze associated with coldness... Got it.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,030
等等  我说真的呢
Wait, I'm being serious.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,760
寒冷穿透你的上颚
So, it permeates the roof of your mouth

38
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,310
冻住了你大脑里的突触
and it freezes the synapses in your brain.

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,320
把你的记忆真正的冻结住了
So, your memories are literally frozen in place.

40
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,680
-才不是呢  -就是
- That is absolutely not true. - It is!

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,170
好啊  试试吧
Okay. Try it.

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,350
不管你在想什么  都会冻结住
Whatever you're thinking about will get frozen in place.

43
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,610
我来问你个问题
I'm gonna ask you a question,

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,070
你的突触解冻前
and you won't be able to answer

45
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,390
你会无法回答我
until the synapses have melted.

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,000
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,380
好  问吧
Okay, ask.

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,110
有多少人在守卫时间守护者
How many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,830
什么
I'm sorry, what?

50
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,110
我们做好闺蜜多久了
How long have we been best friends?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,710
太久了
Too long.

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,040
说真的  你知道你什么都可以跟我说吧
Seriously, you know you can tell me anything, right?

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,060
当然了
Of course.

54
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,970
那你怎么不肯告诉我
Why won't you tell me

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,340
有多少人守卫时间守护者
how many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?

56
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,450
有...
Oh, well, there's...

57
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,170
这地方  我...
This place, I...

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,440
我记得  我认得这里
I remember, I know this place.

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
但我不认得你
But I don't know you.

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,900
没事  你只是累了
It's okay. You're just tired.

61
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,370
嗯  我可能只是累了
Yeah. I'm probably just tired.

62
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,070
电梯在哪
How do I find the elevators?

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,020
是金色的
They're gold.

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,540
全体时间卫队前往军械库
All Minutemen to armory.

65
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,640
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

66
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,170
全体时间卫队前往军械库
All Minutemen to armory.

67
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,090
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

68
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,950
我不知道  长官
I don't know, sir.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,080
全体时间卫队前往军械库
All Minutemen to armory.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,870
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

71
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,190
站住
Stop!

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,860
问几个问题
A few questions.

73
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,090
你真没别的更好的事可做吗
Have you really got nothing else better to do?

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,090
无礼
Rude.

75
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,940
你确定你是个洛基吗
Are you sure you're a Loki?

76
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,170
-你挡我路了  -你是我的路
- You're in my way. - You are my way.

77
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,070
我们或许可以合作
I thought perhaps we could work together.

78
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,420
但看来你缺乏远见
But now I see you lack vision.

79
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,310
你要么自愿跟我来
So, either you'll come willingly...

80
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,210
要么不愿
Or you won't.

81
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,170
不管怎样  你都是我见到时间守护者的办法
Either way, that's how I get to meet the Time-Keepers.

82
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,550
老天啊  闭嘴吧
Oh, God. Shut up!

83
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,520
再靠近  我就杀了他
Come any closer and I'll kill him.

84
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,700
动手吧
Go for it.

85
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,780
放开我的腿
Get off my leg!

86
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,060
再见  时间异体
Goodbye, Variant.

87
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,090
你没电了
You're outta juice.

88
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,860
不好用了
It's not working.

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
好吧
Right...

90
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,270
还给我吧  你都不会充电
Give It to me. You don't know how to recharge it.

91
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,760
我当然会  你不是唯一懂技术的洛基
Of course I do. You're not the only tech savvy Loki.

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,480
永远别那么喊我
Don't ever call me that.

93
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,230
-懂技术  -不  洛基
- Tech savvy? - No, a Loki.

94
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,390
看来你就是个魔术师咯
You're just fully a magician then?

95
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,720
好啊  下个魔术  我把你变没
Fine. For my next trick, I'll make you disappear.

96
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,860
-那是你的能力吗  -你把我们传到哪了
- Is that one of your powers? - Where did you send us?

97
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,220
你个白痴  这里是拉曼蒂斯1号
You idiot! This is Lamentis 1.

98
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,900
我不知道那意味着什么
I don't know what that means!

99
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,070
这颗卫星马上要被那颗行星撞击并摧毁
The moon that planet is about to crash into and destroy.

100
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,150
时空器上存储的所有天启
Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad,

101
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,140
这个是最糟的
this is the worst!

102
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,850
这里无人生还
No one makes it off here!

103
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,710
小心
Watch out!

104
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,300
抱歉  女士
I'm sorry, madam.

105
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,510
我又没时间浏览小册子
Didn't have time to scan the brochure.

106
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,490
对了  我以为你希望我死呢
By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.

107
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,160
我不知道你把时空器藏在哪了
I don't know where you hid that TemPad,

108
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,870
但如果你炸了
but if you blow up,

109
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,470
它就炸了  那我也得炸
it blows up, and then I end up blown up.

110
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,490
那里
There!

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,930
-我们是一队了吗  -才不是
- So we're a team now? - Oh, God, no!

112
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,740
趴下
Get down!

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,400
我才不需要你帮忙
Didn't need your help!

114
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,850
你好奇怪
You're so weird!

115
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,750
你在干什么
What are you doing?

116
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,490
你在干什么
What are you doing?

117
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,790
你是想对我用魅术吗
You trying to enchant me?

118
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,890
不会成功的
It won't work.

119
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,460
为什么  因为你是魔法师吗
Why? Because you're a magician?

120
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,170
-不  因为我的头脑太强大  -好啊
- No, because my mind is too strong. - Fine!

121
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,910
听着  我们真要在这里开战吗  再来
Look. Are we really about to do this here? Again?

122
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,220
那你说怎么办
What do you propose instead?

123
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,990
我不知道  休战吗
I don't know. A truce?

124
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,310
听着  我们如果不能打开时空器
Listen, neither of us is getting off this rock

125
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,070
就都别想离开这星球
if we can't turn that TemPad on.

126
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,350
你藏在哪了
Where do you have it hidden?

127
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,650
-在我心里  -那我就把它挖出来
- In my heart. - Well, then, I'll cut it out.

128
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,230
好啊  真好笑  有趣
Nice. Very droll. Lovely.

129
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,460
好吧  时空器是在我身上
Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad,

130
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,770
但如果你无时无刻
but I'm not gonna get very far

131
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,050
都想要杀我  我也走不了多远
if you keep trying to kill me every 30 seconds.

132
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,900
你满嘴谎言
You're full of it

133
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,910
因为你需要我才能给它充电
because you need me to get that thing recharged.

134
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,220
所以你刚刚才会在外面救我
That's the only reason you saved me out there.

135
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,100
或许吧
Maybe.

136
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,750
嗯  是  还有那个原因
Yeah. I mean, sure. That too.

137
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,410
我们也可以在这个废弃矿井里
Or we could slaughter each other here

138
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,490
互相残杀
in this abandoned mining shack.

139
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,310
-怎么样  -我觉得挺好
- What do you say? - Good for me.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,060
你打断的计划  我已筹划多年
The plan you interrupted was years in the making.

141
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,410
-多年  -知道了
- Years! - Okay, got it.

142
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,640
我一启动时空器
And as soon as I turn that TemPad back on,

143
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
就会马上回时管局
I'm going straight back to the TVA

144
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,520
去了结我开始的战斗
to finish what I started.

145
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,410
很好
Good.

146
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,210
-到时我就杀了你  -或者是我杀了你
- I'll kill you then. - Or I'll kill you.

147
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,870
你去哪
Where're you going?

148
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,940
这卫星上有电力
There's power somewhere on this moon.

149
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,950
我们只需要足够电力
We just need enough of it

150
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,390
便可以穿越跨维度时空
to travel through inter-dimensional time and space.

151
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,990
天啊
Jeez!

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,190
嗯
Yep.

153
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,180
怎么计划的
So, what's the plan?

154
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,040
这里附近有个镇  你能不能闭嘴
There's a town near here. And can you shut up?

155
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,970
虽然我不得不跟你合作
Just because I have to work with you

156
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,750
不代表我想听到你的声音
doesn't mean I wanna hear your voice.

157
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,480
好啊  慢点  时间异体
All right, well... Slow down, Variant.

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,570
死亡迫近你是哪里不懂
What part of imminent death confuses you?

159
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,960
别喊我"时间异体"
And don't call me "Variant."

160
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,560
抱歉  但我不会把我的褪色复印版称为"洛基"
I'm sorry, but I'm not calling some faded photocopy of me "Loki."

161
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,010
很好  因为我已经不是那个人了
Good. 'Cause that's not who I am anymore.

162
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,430
我现在是茜薇
I'm Sylvie now.

163
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,620
你改了名字  太好了
You changed your name. Brilliant.

164
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,700
这叫假名
It's called an alias.

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,650
不怎么像洛基
It's not very Loki-like.

166
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,080
是吗  那怎么才算洛基行为
Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?

167
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,210
独立  权威  风格
Independence, authority, style.

168
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,570
所以自然而然地  你去为
So, naturally you went to work

169
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,160
无聊压迫的时间警察工作了
for the boring, oppressive time police.

170
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,780
我不为他们工作  我是个顾问
I don't work for them. I'm a consultant.

171
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,410
你都不知道你想要什么
You don't know what you want.

172
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,790
是吗  那你呢
Oh, yeah? What about you?

173
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,390
你筹划了数年的计划
Your years-in-the-making plan

174
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,220
就是毁了那里
was to tear the place down,

175
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
创造一个终极权力真空
create the ultimate power vacuum,

176
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,390
然后走开
and then just walk away.

177
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,220
我绝不会那么做
I'd never have done that.

178
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,480
是吗  我可不是你
Yeah? Well, I'm not you.

179
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,870
我们能不能赶紧继续了
Can we get on with this now?

180
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,280
看来大家都跑了
It looks like everyone already fled.

181
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,080
如果是的话  那也是徒劳
If they did, it was in vain.

182
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,000
他们还有多久
How long do we have?

183
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,810
12小时左右
Twelve hours or so.

184
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,020
这里的情况只会更糟
Things down here are only gonna get worse.

185
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,540
更多陨石  重力地震
More meteors, gravity quakes,

186
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,050
当然  还有面临毁灭时的社会崩溃
and of course, the collapse of society in the face of annihilation.

187
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,370
那个能给时空器充电吗
Could that charge the TemPad?

188
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,750
或许吧
Maybe.

189
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,920
我在查看耦合装置
I'm just checking the coupling.

190
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,600
确保连接好了
Making sure it can connect.

191
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,450
好
Right.

192
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,930
好了  给我吧
Okay. Hand it over.

193
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,410
真可悲  我才不会给你呢
Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you.

194
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,260
你还得更努力点
You're gonna have to try harder than that.

195
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,990
那也别向我提你的"懂技术"的点子
Then don't give me your "Tech savvy" ideas either.

196
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,330
时空器需要大量电力
The TemPad requires a massive power source,

197
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,660
夜灯是不够的
not a night light.

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,090
蛮力不能替代交涉和诡计
Brute force is no substitute for diplomacy and guile.

199
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
知道了
Noted.

200
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,670
你能走到这一步都令人惊叹
It's remarkable that you ever made it as far as you did.

201
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,390
抱歉了
Sorry about that.

202
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,950
不必  我可开心了
Don't be. I enjoyed it.

203
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,240
我也是呢
I did too.

204
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,330
但请相信我
But I can assure you,

205
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,290
尽管我的...同伴行为粗暴
despite my acquaintance behaving like an animal...

206
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,910
我们并无恶意
...uh, we mean you no harm.

207
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,090
我们只是疲劳旅人
We're simply weary travelers.

208
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,330
当然了
Sure you are.

209
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,720
你好  亲爱的
Hello, dear.

210
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,250
帕崔斯
Patrice?

211
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,030
好久没见
It... It's been a long time.

212
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,900
你还是那么美...
You're as beautiful as...

213
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,340
帕崔斯30年来从没说过那么客气的话
Patrice never said a thing that nice in 30 years.

214
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,690
你们不是旅人  你们是魔鬼
You're no travelers, you're devils.

215
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,720
那算什么  交涉吗
Which one was that? Diplomacy?

216
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,630
-还是...  -别  别说了
- Or... - Don't. Just don't.

217
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,060
你们两个魔鬼想要什么
What do you devils want with me?

218
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,930
我们只想问你个问题  人都哪去了
We just wanna ask you a question. Where is everyone?

219
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,460
方舟
The ark.

220
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,750
撤离船
The evacuation vessel.

221
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,950
那样的东西就有足够给
Something like that would have enough juice

222
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,580
时空器充能的电力
to repower the TemPad.

223
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,410
我们怎么过去
How do we get there?

224
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,370
火车站在镇边界
Train station's the edge of town.

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,740
但你们别想买到票
But you'll never get a ticket.

226
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,490
我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

227
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,670
安静
Quiet down!

228
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,720
退后
Get back!

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,990
怎么回事
What's going on?

230
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,830
方舟今晚就走
The ark leaves tonight

231
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,660
我们排队排了好几个小时了
and we've been waiting in line for hours.

232
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,520
好几个小时了
For hours.

233
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,430
看上去真好玩
Well, this looks fun.

234
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,680
走吧
Come on.

235
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
我们别想打上火车
We can't fight our way onto that train.

236
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,510
谁说要打了
Who said anything about fighting?

237
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,960
-你的计划都跟打有关  -这个没有
- All your plans involve fighting. - Not this one.

238
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,400
我用魅术控制一个卫兵
I'm going to enchant a guard,

239
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520
让他带我们穿过人群
have him lead us through the crowd,

240
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,500
如果有人敢找我们事
and if anyone gives us any trouble...

241
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,020
就让他开枪吗
Make him start shooting?

242
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,070
然后呢  杀了所有卫兵  然后劫持火车吗
And then what, kill every guard and hijack the train?

243
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,570
要不要打  就看他们的了
Whether or not there's a fight is entirely up to them.

244
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,650
这次  我们按我的办法来
We're doing this one my way.

245
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,640
-我看上去如何  -像是计划不怎么样的人
- How do I look? - Like someone with a shit plan.

246
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,770
这计划多好
It's a great plan.

247
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,580
看我眼色行事
Just follow my lead.

248
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,420
-我们为什么不能上  -让我们上去
- Why can't we get on? - Let us in! Come on!

249
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,380
去苏鲁吗  这边请  先生
To Shuroo? This way, sir.

250
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,330
让我们上去  女人和小孩
Let us in! Women and children...

251
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,220
他们只把票给有钱人
They're only giving tickets out to the wealthy!

252
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,590
我们怎么办
What about us?

253
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,050
请出示车票
Tickets?

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,630
我要带这家伙去苏鲁
Taking this one to Shuroo.

255
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,380
好啊  票呢
Okay. And the tickets?

256
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,900
我有来自上方的命令  要带她上车
Orders come from the top to get her on this train.

257
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,760
长官  他们...
Sir, this...

258
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,190
没什么事吧
Everything okay?

259
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,370
嗯  一切都好
Yeah, everything's fine.

260
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,650
我刚记起来总部今早用无线电发来消息
Yeah, I just remembered that headquarters radioed in

261
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,650
要他们上车
their request for them this morning.

262
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,850
好吧
Okay.

263
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,190
好
Okay.

264
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,310
请出示车票
Tickets?

265
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,630
晚上好  乘客们
Good evening, passengers.

266
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,160
我坐火车不能坐逆行方向
Um, uh, look, I can't go backwards on a train.

267
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,220
我从不背对门坐
Well, I never sit with my back to a door.

268
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,740
什么  两边都有门啊
What? There are doors on both sides.

269
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,370
坐下吧
Oh, just sit down.

270
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,310
对了  那都不叫计划
FYI, that wasn't even a plan.

271
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,460
是吗
Oh, really?

272
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,030
计划要分很多步
Plans have multiple steps.

273
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,270
假扮成卫兵
Dressing as a guard

274
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,830
上火车只是做一件事
and getting on a train is just doing a thing.

275
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,380
你累了吗
Oh, you a bit tired?

276
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,420
尽管休息一下吧
Feel free to, you know, get some rest.

277
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,920
我无法在这样的地方睡觉
I can't sleep in a place like this.

278
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,820
你无法在火车上睡觉吗
You can't sleep on a train?

279
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,520
不是  我不能在不可靠的人旁边睡觉
No. I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.

280
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,270
这样啊  是说我吗
Oh, right. That me?

281
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,990
但你可以打个盹
But you feel free to take a nap.

282
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,580
想得美
Nice try.

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,830
我不会浪费时间到处找时空器
I'm not gonna waste my time rooting around for the TemPad

284
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,220
显然有人教你魔法教得很好
when someone taught you fairly decent magic.

285
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,820
是我妈妈
My mother.

286
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,830
她什么样
What was she like?

287
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,190
她是...
She was, um...

288
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,790
阿斯加德王后
A Queen of Asgard.

289
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,290
她很好  很正派
She was good. Purely decent.

290
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,190
你确定她是你母亲吗
Are you sure she was your mother?

291
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,640
不  其实她不是  我是领养的
Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted.

292
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,470
剧透了吗  抱歉
Is that a bit of a spoiler for you? Sorry about that.

293
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,030
不  我知道我是领养的
No, I knew I was adopted.

294
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,430
什么  他们告诉你了吗
What? They told you?

295
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,110
-对  他们没告诉你吗  -没
- Yeah. Did they not tell you? - No.

296
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,710
他们最终说了
I mean, they did, eventually.

297
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,710
等等
Hang on a second.

298
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,860
跟我说说你妈妈
So, tell... Tell me about your mother.

299
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,890
我不怎么记得她了
I barely remember her.

300
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,980
到现在只剩梦的碎片了
Just blips of a dream at this point.

301
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,090
我小时候
You know, when I was young,

302
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,530
她会为我施展小魔法
she'd do these little bits of magic for me.

303
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,630
比如把花变成青蛙
Like turn a flower into a frog or

304
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,580
或在水上放烟花
cast fireworks over the water.

305
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,920
看上去那么不可思议
It all seemed impossible.

306
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,560
但她跟我说  有一天我也能做到
But she told me that one day I'd be able to do it too because...

307
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
因为我什么都能做到
Because I could do anything.

308
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,070
你想看看吗
You wanna see?

309
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,510
不赖
Not bad.

310
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,000
她是那种  你希望她相信你的人
She was the kinda person you'd want to believe in you.

311
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,500
听上去她是相信你
Sounds like she does.

312
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,980
她生前是相信我
Well, she did.

313
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,720
那你怎么学会...
So, where'd you learn to do the...

314
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,330
-就是...那个  -我自学的
- You know, the... Whatever it is? - I taught myself.

315
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,640
-你自学了那样的魔法  -对
- You taught yourself that magic? - Yeah, I did.

316
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,290
你怎么...
What, do you just...

317
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,830
你潜入他们的大脑  投射某种幻觉吗
You just go into their minds and project some sort of illusion?

318
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,980
我直接施展一下更容易懂
It'd be easier if I just show...

319
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,500
对我施魅术  让我交出时空器
Enchanted me and make me give you the TemPad

320
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
你好跳出行驶的火车吗
so you can leap out the moving train?

321
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,310
-不了  谢谢  -那就别问
- No, thank you. - Well then, don't ask.

322
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,840
-好啊  -香槟酒
- Okay. - Champagne?

323
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,420
好啊  非常感谢
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

324
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,090
不了  谢谢
No, I'm good, thanks.

325
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,550
那她的我拿了  谢谢
Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you.

326
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,190
干杯
Cheers.

327
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,490
敬世界末日
To the end of the world.

328
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,610
那老女人选择赴死好可惜啊  是吧
A pity the old woman chose to die, don't you think?

329
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,390
-她心里有爱  -她恨他
- She was in love. - She hated him.

330
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,920
或许爱就是恨
Maybe love is hate.

331
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,280
或许该记下来
Should probably remember that.

332
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,910
什么来着  "爱是..."
What was that? "Love is..."

333
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,250
-"爱是恨"  -滚吧
- "Love is hate." - Oh, piss off!

334
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,700
说到爱
So, on the subject of love,

335
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,410
这场征途结束时
is there a lucky beau

336
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,510
会有哪个幸运情郎在等待你吗
waiting for you at the end of this crusade?

337
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,410
有  还真有
Yeah, there is, actually.

338
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,760
奔波在
Managed to maintain

339
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,980
一个又一个天启之间时
quite a serious long-distance relationship with a postman

340
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,190
还得以跟一个
whilst running across time...

341
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,710
邮递员维系了一段认真的异地恋
...from one apocalypse to another.

342
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,540
如此有魅力  谁能抵挡你呢
With charm like that, who could resist you?

343
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,070
面对必死命运的人  什么都愿意
Well, people are quite willing in the face of certain doom.

344
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,420
当然了
I'm sure they are.

345
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,540
只是为了有动力前进
It was only ever just to keep me going.

346
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,090
你呢  你可是王子
How about you? You're a prince.

347
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,420
肯定有准王妃吧
Must've been would-be-princesses

348
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,740
或许  是另一位王子
or perhaps, another prince.

349
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,170
都有吧  我猜你也是
A bit of both. I suspect the same as you.

350
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,750
但没有过...
But, nothing ever...

351
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,290
真情
Real.

352
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,000
那么爱是诡计咯
Love is mischief, then.

353
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,130
不
No.

354
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,080
爱是...
Love is...

355
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,970
我...
uh, something I

356
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,130
可能需要再喝一杯才能去想的事
might have to have another drink to think about.

357
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,350
你知道我们打算劫持一个文明
You do realize we're about to try and hijack

358
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,140
仅剩希望的电力吧
the power source to a civilization's only hope?

359
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,250
-知道  -不会轻松的
- I do. - It's not gonna be easy.

360
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,280
我们该休息一下
We should rest.

361
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,170
好啊  你以你的方式放松  我也是
All right. You relax your way and I'll relax mine.

362
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,890
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

363
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,720
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

364
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,550
你的制服呢
Where's your uniform?

365
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,970
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

366
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,790
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

367
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,660
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

368
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,480
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

369
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,280
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

370
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,620
她唱起歌  她歌唱回家
When she sings, she sings come home

371
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,140
-敬茜薇  各位  -好啊
- To Sylvie, everybody! - Yeah!

372
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,340
再来一杯
Another!

373
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,390
你喝醉了
You're drunk.

374
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,900
不  我只是喝饱了
No, I'm just full.

375
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,430
记住了  我喝得很饱
But bear in mind, I'm very full.

376
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,330
你来尝尝这个
Now, I need you to try this.

377
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,870
跟无花果酒特别搭
It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port.

378
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,210
还有谁有无花果酒
Who's got the Figgy Port?

379
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,250
你得相信我了  无花果酒真的好喝
You have to take my word on the Figgy Port.

380
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,650
你的制服呢  我们本该隐匿行事的
Where's your uniform? We're meant to be laying low.

381
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,640
没人在乎  这是世界末日
Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.

382
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,940
-我觉得出事了  -对
- I think something's happening. - Yes.

383
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,260
那颗行星要撞上我们了
Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.

384
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,130
别犯浑  我看到有人用奇怪的目光打量你
Don't be an ass. I saw some people looking at you weirdly.

385
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,060
什么
What?

386
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,440
你怎么变得这么多疑
When did you get so paranoid?

387
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,540
大概是因为我这辈子都在逃避
I guess it must have started when I spent my entire life

388
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,050
你为他们工作的无所不在的法西斯
running from the omniscient fascists you work for.

389
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,620
浪费了那个好可惜
It's a shame to let that go to waste.

390
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,720
换个话题  我想到答案了
Change of subject. I thought of an answer.

391
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,670
什么的答案
To what?

392
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,840
你的问题
Your question.

393
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,300
爱是把匕首
Love is a dagger.

394
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,800
是可以在远处  或在近处挥动的武器
It's a weapon to be wielded far away or up close.

395
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,380
你可以在其中看到自己  它很美
You can see yourself in it. It's beautiful.

396
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,340
直到它让你流血
Until it makes you bleed.

397
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,100
但最终  你去抓时
But ultimately, when you reach for it...

398
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,300
-它不是真的  -对
- It isn't real. - Yeah.

399
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,200
爱是把想象的匕首
Love is an imaginary dagger.

400
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,460
说不通  是吧
Doesn't make sense, does it?

401
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,230
对  这比喻烂透了
No. Terrible metaphor.

402
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,290
该死  我还以为我想得挺好
Damn. I thought I had something there.

403
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,120
就是他
That's him.

404
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,500
-淡定  -没事的
- Stay cool. - It's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,520
先生  能出示车票吗
Sir, can I see your tickets?

406
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,400
又是你  你好
You again. Hello.

407
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,040
车票  当然  给你
Um, tickets. Yes, of course. Here they are.

408
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,710
还是挺漂亮的  是吧
Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?

409
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,300
真有这个必要吗
Look, is this really necessary?

410
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,840
这有个简单的解释
There is a simple explanation...

411
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,700
什么
What?

412
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,080
让开
Get out of the way.

413
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,570
准头好差
Awful throw.

414
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,220
能不能别闹了
Oh, will you stop it?

415
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,910
再见
Bye.

416
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,430
时空器
TemPad.

417
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,460
这可不理想
Well, that's not ideal.

418
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,530
-把时空器给我  -好吧  好吧
- Give me the TemPad. - All right. All right. Okay.

419
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,640
我结结实实地摔了一跤
Well, I did take quite the tumble.

420
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,870
你个混蛋  你害死了我们
You asshole. You killed us.

421
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,560
也许能修好它  好吗
Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um...

422
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,970
你认真不起来
You're not a serious man.

423
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,300
你说得对  我是神
You're right. I'm a god.

424
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,350
你是个小丑  你在火车上喝多了
You're a clown. You got drunk on the train.

425
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,920
我是享乐主义者  享乐主义者就这样
I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.

426
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,160
我才是享乐主义者
I'm hedonistic.

427
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,910
比你资深多了  我跟你保证
A lot more than you, I assure you.

428
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,340
但我绝不会为此牺牲任务
But never at the expense of the mission.

429
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,030
任务  还任务
Oh, the mission? The mission?

430
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,640
你的光荣使命吗
What, your glorious purpose?

431
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,340
省省吧  你打不过他们的
Give me a break. You can't beat them.

432
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,070
好吧
Okay.

433
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,430
喊出来之后有没有好受点
Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?

434
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,810
是好受了
Yes, it did.

435
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,710
你改天也应该试试
You should try it sometime.

436
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,190
现在怎么办
What now?

437
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,260
-我不知道  你把时空器弄坏了  -那个...
- I don't know. You broke the TemPad. - Well...

438
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,050
那颗行星即将撞上我们
And that planet is about to crash into us.

439
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,550
-是啊  但是...  -但是什么
- Well, yes, but... - Yes, but what?

440
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,580
但整个卫星不都被摧毁了吗
Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?

441
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,180
对  上面的人都死了
Yeah. And everyone on it is killed.

442
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,700
-也包括我们  -对  也包括我们
- Including us. - Yes, including us.

443
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,050
那方舟呢
What about the ark?

444
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,500
方舟未能启航  因为它被毁了
The ark never leaves because it's destroyed.

445
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,600
那是我们没登船
Never had us on it.

446
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,780
那怎么  我们劫持方舟  确保它离开这卫星
So what? We hijack the ark and make sure it gets off this moon?

447
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,510
我觉得是个好主意
I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.

448
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,980
好吧
Okay.

449
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,030
真的吗
Really?

450
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,050
我这辈子好像都没走过这么多路
You know, I don't think I've ever walked this much in my life.

451
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,660
那你过得可真好
That's a pretty good life.

452
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,940
幸好你错过了
Well, you're lucky you missed it.

453
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,370
我有个想法  你对我施魅术
Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me

454
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,710
然后你一个人走我俩的路
and you could walk for both of us?

455
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,340
或者我在潜意识里小睡一觉
Or I take a nap in my subconscious,

456
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,080
然后等我们到地方  你再叫醒我  行吗
and then you could just wake me when we arrive. Yeah?

457
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,160
魅术不是这样的
Yeah, that's not how enchantment works.

458
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,500
好吧  那魅术是什么样的
All right, how does it work?

459
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,840
不重要了
Doesn't matter.

460
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,870
我觉得我给你讲了太多关于我的事
You know, I feel like I've told you so much about me.

461
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,680
但我对你一无所知
I really don't know the first thing about you.

462
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,460
谢谢你给的战术优势
Thanks for the tactical advantage.

463
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,970
所以时管局一出现  你就想利用这一优势
Ah, so, you want to use that tactical advantage to kill me

464
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,210
干掉我
when the TVA shows up.

465
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,310
你担心是吗
Worried, are you?

466
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,400
我就是想知道我能不能信任你
I just need to know if I can trust you.

467
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,250
好吧
Okay, fine.

468
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,280
你想知道魅术是怎么回事
You want to know how enchantment works.

469
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,000
我得进行身体接触
I have to make physical contact

470
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,120
然后控制人的思维
and then grab hold of their mind.

471
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,150
怎么做
How?

472
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,810
这取决于思维
It depends on the mind.

473
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,690
大多数思维都很简单  我可以立即取得控制
Most are easy and I can overtake them instantly.

474
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,450
其他更强大一些的就比较棘手
Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky.

475
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,170
虽然我能掌控  但他们的意识也在
I'm in control, but they're there, too.

476
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,310
为了保持连接
In order to preserve the connection,

477
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,930
我必须用他们的记忆创建出一个幻觉
I have to create a fantasy from their memories.

478
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,330
你还说我是魔法师呢
And you call me a magician.

479
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,900
时管局的那个年轻士兵  她的大脑很混乱
That young soldier from the TVA, her mind was messed up.

480
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,230
一切都模糊不清
Everything clouded.

481
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,310
我不得不提取她几百年前的记忆
I had to pull a memory from hundreds of years prior,

482
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,890
在她都还没为他们工作前
before she even fought for them.

483
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,550
什么  你刚说什么
What? What'd you just say?

484
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,790
在她加入时管局之前
Before she joined the TVA?

485
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,760
是的  那时她只是地球上的一个普通人
Yeah. She was just a regular person on Earth.

486
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,880
一个普通人
A regular person?

487
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,300
很喜欢喝玛格丽塔酒
Loved margaritas.

488
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,620
我被告知  时管局的所有员工
I was told that everyone who works for the TVA

489
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,490
都是由时间守护者创造出来的
was created by the Time-Keepers.

490
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,920
太荒谬了  他们都是时间异体  和我们一样
That's ridiculous. They're all Variants, just like us.

491
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,600
他们并不知道
They don't know that.

492
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,420
所有持票乘客...
All ticketed passengers...

493
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,800
那是我们的飞船
That's our ride.

494
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,410
十分钟后起飞
Ten minutes until launch.

495
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,590
最后一次登船广播
Final boarding call.

496
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,070
我们信任彼此吗
Do we trust each other?

497
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,360
是的  你可以信任我
We do and you can.

498
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,770
很好  因为这会很糟
Good. Because this is gonna suck.

499
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,380
保持冷静  我们已达最大载客量
Remain calm. We're now at capacity.

500
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,440
各位请回家
Please return to your homes.

501
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,420

五分钟后起飞
Five minutes until launch.

505
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,400
他们要任由这些人死去
They're gonna let these people die.

506
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,680
五分钟后起飞
Five minutes until launch.

507
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,780
我们必须上船  确保它起飞
We have to get on and make sure it takes off.

508
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,660
怎么做
How?

509
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,810
-我们绕过去  -好的
- We go around. - Okay.

510

- You okay? - Yeah.

514
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,890
等等  站住
Hold it! Stop right there.

515
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,620
快走
Just go.

516
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,160
这边
Over here!

517
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,180
你不会有事的
You're gonna be okay.

518
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,620
不  不  等等
No! No, wait!

519
